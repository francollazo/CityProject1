                <h2>Monuments</h2>

                <p>This website contains information about the monuments and mythical places 
                    of Madrid. </p>    
                
                <p>In Madrid, there are many monuments that are very important for the country 
                    and which are also public and can be visited by everyone free of charge, 
                    such as the Retiro Park.</p>

                <h3>Plaza Mayor</h3>
            </header>

            <p>Probably the most visited monument in Madrid and dates back to the 16th century. 
                It was the main marketplace, the scene of events such as bullfights or public 
                executions -by gallows, knife or axe-, and today it is one of the nerve centres 
                of tourism. In the middle is the equestrian statue of Felipe III, from 1606, 
                another Madrid icon.</p>

                <h3>Puerta de Alcalá</h3>
            </header>

            <p>The Puerta de Alcalá, located in the Plaza de la Independencia, was commissioned 
                by Madrid's favourite king, Carlos III. It was one of the five ancient royal gates 
                that gave access to the city for travellers coming from France. It was the first 
                triumphal arch built in Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire, before the Arc de 
                Triomphe in Paris and the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.</p>

                <h3>Retiro Park</h3>
            </header>

            <p>Our little Central Park is one of the places you have to visit in Madrid. Every 
                self-respecting Madrileño has enjoyed a Sunday boat ride on its pond. This PRECIOUS 
                park is home to a lot of unforgettable artistic references: architectural, sculptural 
                and landscape ensembles from the 17th to the 21st centuries and the famous Palacio de 
                Cristal. For mystery lovers... it contains one of the few statues in the world 
                dedicated to Lucifer, 'The Fountain of the Fallen Angel', at an exact height of 666 
                metres above sea level.</p>
