                <h1>Legends and history of Madrid</h1>

                <p>Madrid's origins date back to the pre-Roman period, when the area was no more than 
                    a rural region. The remains of a Visigothic basilica found on the present site of 
                    the Almudena Cathedral demonstrate the strong likelihood of settlement.</p>

                <p>The first evidence of permanent settlement is during the Muslim period, with the 
                    construction of a defensive fortress by the river. It is believed that the name Madrid 
                    comes from this 9th century Muslim fortified settlement, called Mayrīţ.</p>
                    
                <p>It is thought to have been built very close to the present-day site of the Royal Palace, 
                    on a promontory by the Manzanares River.</p>
